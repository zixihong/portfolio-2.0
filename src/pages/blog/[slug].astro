“it is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”

instead of chasing money, lust, and material things, focus on what truly matters -- purpose, love, and genuine connection.

if you are in the position to, don't get a job straight of college; instead, go explore the world. you only live once, and finding meaning is far more valuable than getting rich.

you can never REALLY be wrong in politics. 

recently, a couple friends and i had a discussion about this topic, so i wanted to approach this with a philosophical point-of-view on my blog. 

now don't get me wrong, i can disagree with your political opinions or your logical foundation could be flawed and therefore you are "wrong", but there is no right or wrong in someone's political foundation. at the most fundamental core, politics are simply a reflection of the lessons we've learned, mistakes we've made, and paths we've taken. when we argue about politics, we're not just debating policies and statistics -- we're arguing about our lived experiences down to our philosophical core. 

recently, healthcare policy has been at the center of debate, and at first glance, there seems to be a clear moral imperative: the best healthcare policy is one that prevents suffering and saves the most lives. a utilitarian framework suggests that the policy maximizing the greatest good for the greatest number is morally correct. but that prompts an interesting question: why is a utilitarian framework more favored than others?

before i continue, i want to preface that i'm not going to publicly take sides in this debate on my blog. i do fundamentally align myself with a philosophical framework, but the purpose of this entire blog is to point out that whatever framework i align myself with is NOT the OBJECTIVELY correct answer because there ISN'T an objectively right or wrong framework.

to return back to question of utilitarian superiority, other ethical frameworks also exist in this context. a libertarian perspective emphasizing individual rights and minimal government intervention might argue that forcing some to pay for others' healthcare violates fundamental principles of personal autonomy, and deontological ethics would debate about whether healthcare is a fundamental right or a personal responsibility. each framework provides a unique lens through which to view the same issue, and each person's lived experiences naturally pull them toward certain philosophical approaches. these lived experiences include anything from the books we've read and the people we've met to the news we've seen online and the places we've been.

and if political opinions = a reflection of our lived experiences, then on the macroscopic level, no person's political beliefs are any more right or wrong compared to anyone else's. that means that it's imperative to recognize that your OWN political views are not objective truths but subjective opinions.

before i close out this blog, i want to reiterate that while i think a person can never be fundamentally incorrect about politics, their logic, supported by evidence and analysis, could be flawed. that's why it's so important that we examine all of our political beliefs from a larger perspective and critically analyze the "why" behind our thoughts.

being on the quarter system means that i'm alone while all my friends are gone and enjoying college. it's kind of crazy to me that most of them have already been in college for an entire month now. and in this solitude, i've really learned to enjoy my own company.

this is a complete juxtaposition from summer when i was spending every second with friends, and now, when everyone's gone, it's made me realize that i kind of forgot to focus on ME for the last 3 months. thankfully, i think this last month has really made up for it.

I've been working like crazy recently; probably coding for at least 9 hours (?) a day. and through this solitude and work, I've realized that growth only happens during times of self reflection and solitude. sure, being around friends is fulfilling in a lot of senses, but true growth happens when you take time to just think about yourself. contextualize yourself within your environment and within your community, and really see yourself grow and expaond to fit into it. 

for me, at least, this contextualizing only occurs when i'm alone. now, i'm def not saying that my friends are a distraction, but i think being alone really brings out a different, and dare i say, better side of you. you're not looking to impress anyone; everything that you are doing is strictly for you. and when you direct this much focus to yourself, growth naturally follows along. the only plants that grow are the ones that you water. 

so really, it's a balance between watering the relationships with your friends and watering the plant of your own personal growth. and finding this balance is what makes us, us.

visionaries don't see further or wider than anyone else; they just see what others don't. and in a sense, this is what being delusional means.

i'm going to sound like an obnoxious combination between kendrick lamar on 'pride' and sam altman starting a yc interview, but i hope to give you guys a new perspective into the "why" behind challenging society and the fundamental definition of being a visionary.

defined by the oxford english dictionary, delusion is the act of holding firm onto an idea despite "incontrovertible evidence to the contrary." but the psychological core of all visionaries that makes them so different than everyone else is their ability to see things that others miss; to grasp onto an idea when no one else even opened their palms. its their ability to always find a case against "incontrovertible evidence" that makes them fundamentally a visionary. see, this entire term of "incontrovertible evidence" just means evidence that is widely accepted and found within society today, but as i've done so many times in my previous blogs, i want to again make the case that the collective whole of society isn't always right. and a certain population of visionaries can always "take down" this collective whole.

now what does any of this even mean? (hang with me here)

visionaries always challenge preestablished notions despite there being "incontrovertible evidence". now keep in mind, visionaries can be anyone--doctors, lawyers, waitresses, government workers--anyone who has the ability to recognize the flaws in our society today. i am not saying that i think i'm a visionary; i haven't done anything yet. but being able to poke holes into society's fabric of right or wrong is such a powerful ability that i think everyone should develop. 

"incontrovertible evidence" is just notions that are widely accepted by society today: taxis are the best way for people to get around without a car, people live in hotels during vacations. but a visionary will always challenge this "incontrovertible evidence" because they look deeper into the "why" behind the things we do, even if it's something that has been preestablished for decades. behind the founders of uber and airbnb, they were just regular people who weren't afraid to challenge the way people transported without cars or the way people lived in temporary establishments, and by challenging these things, they were able to reinvent what we now consider as "incontrovertible evidence". uber and airbnb, are now seen as fundamental in our world today; they tore down preestablished notions to build up new ones. and in a couple of decades or centuries, this cycle will perpetually continue itself when others challenge these ideas. 

society works because there is a certain group of people who who will continually tear down old "inconvertible evidence" and build up new "inconvertible evidence". and this, as pointed out by the oxford dictionary, is just people being delusional.

regret builds character. 

i just received my college results, and i can't say that i am particularly ecstatic about my choices of colleges next fall (i do have some good ones + waitlists so we'll see). but neither am i particularly surprised. 

i was a slacker back in sophomore year; no clue what the heck i was doing back in zhong's calculus class. and even till this day, it's been my biggest regret that i didn't put in just a little more effort to get an A. but u can't change the past, and neither do i want to.

see, after zhong's calculus class, that feeling of regret made me promise myself to never slack off in a class again; to never procrastinate on hw, to never skip a textbook reading. this feeling of regret taught me that life moves on, and i had a choice to either sit and pity about my gpa or work my ass off trying to fix it. and it's this feeling of regret that i believe builds the most character in people.

we regret because we care. we wanted those results so badly, and yet, our effort simply didn't match up. this inequivalence is what causes us to feel regret: regret: how much we want it > how much effort we put in. 

i can't go back and change the past so that i can work harder in zhong's class and get into all the dream colleges i wanted to get into, but neither do i want to. i already know that this feeling of regret is going to change me so much, and in the long run, i WILL become a better person as a result of this no matter where i end up going to college.
